You've intercepted a classified transmission from a secret cyber lab. Buried inside is a digital message containing a highly sensitive secret. But the lab's AI security has scrambled the signal: the message has been fragmented into hundreds of pieces and camouflaged with the lab's signature emblem.
Some fragments overlap, some hide beneath the emblem, and others appear incomplete. To make sense of the transmission, you'll need to observe patterns across the pieces and identify how the signal emerges when the fragments interact.
Careful observation will reveal that the darkest marks carry the truth, while distractions in the background may mislead. Only by leveraging the collective behavior of the pieces will the hidden information become readable.
This isn't just a puzzle it's a test of precision, patience, and ingenuity. One misstep, one overlooked fragment, and the secret could remain hidden indefinitely. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WoSBU00z35MbBBJJIigpkfDy-rCFCIt_?usp=sharing
